This dataset offers modeled daily fire danger time series, driven by seasonal weather forecasts. It provides long-range predictions of meteorological conditions conducive to the initiation, spread, and persistence of fires. The fire danger metrics included in this dataset are part of an extensive dataset produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS). EFFIS and GWIS are used for monitoring and forecasting fire danger at both European and global scales. The dataset incorporates fire danger indices from the U.S. Forest Service National Fire-Danger Rating System (NFDRS), the Canadian Forest Service Fire Weather Index Rating System (FWI), and the Australian McArthur (Mark 5) rating systems.
